        <h1>NES History</h1>
        <p>From 1985 to 1995, the NES revolutionized gaming, becoming a cultural phenomenon. Launched by Nintendo in 1985, it revived the video game market after the 1983 crash. Iconic games like Super Mario Bros. and The Legend of Zelda helped define the era. The NES also introduced the concept of "Nintendo Seal of Quality" in 1991, ensuring better game standards. By 1995, the NES was phased out as the SNES took over, but its impact on gaming history remains immense.</p>

	<ul class="history">
		<li>Before the NES, Nintendo released the Famicom (short for Family Computer) in Japan in 1983. It was a 8-bit console that introduced many of the same principles that would later define the NES, such as interchangeable cartridges. The Famicom featured a similar pin-based cartridge system, allowing for easy game swaps. While it was initially a success in Japan, it faced challenges, including an early design flaw with its pins. Despite this, the Famicom laid the groundwork for the NES's global success, especially when it was redesigned and released in North America in 1985 as the NES.</li>
		<li>The Nintendo Game & Watch was a series of handheld electronic games released in 1980, marking Nintendo's first major foray into portable gaming. These devices featured simple LCD screens and one or two games each, becoming a massive success and laying the foundation for later handheld consoles like the Game Boy.</li>
		<li>Nintendo has also found success in the arcade with hits like Donkey Kong (1981) and Pac-Man clones. These arcade games helped establish Nintendo as a major player in the gaming industry, with Donkey Kong introducing the world to Mario and setting the stage for the company's future in home consoles.</li>
